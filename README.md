Recircle Project
‚ôªÔ∏è Introduction
Welcome to Recircle! This project is a response to the growing problem of waste and the need for a more sustainable way of living. Recircle is a community-based mobile application designed to facilitate the exchange and recycling of used items, connecting people who want to give away things they no longer need with those who can give them a new life. Our goal is to reduce landfill waste, promote a circular economy, and build stronger, more environmentally-conscious communities.

‚ú® Key Features
Recircle comes with a range of features designed to make decluttering and sustainable living easy and enjoyable:

Item Listing: Easily post items you want to give away with photos, descriptions, and categories.

Smart Search & Filtering: Find exactly what you're looking for with powerful search and filters based on category, location, and condition.

In-App Chat: Securely communicate with other users to arrange pickups and ask questions without sharing personal contact information.

Interactive Map View: Browse available items in your local area using a user-friendly map interface.

User Profiles & Ratings: Build trust within the community through profiles that show user history and ratings from past exchanges.

Wishlists & Notifications: Create a "wishlist" of items you're looking for and get notified when a matching item becomes available near you.

Community Hub: A dedicated space to share recycling tips, DIY project ideas using upcycled materials, and local environmental event information.

Impact Tracker: Visualize your positive environmental impact! The app tracks how many items you've recirculated and estimates the waste you've helped divert from landfills.
